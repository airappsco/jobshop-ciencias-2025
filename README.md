# Air Apps Landing Page Prompt Challenge (2025)
 
 ## Overview
 
 Welcome to the **Air Apps Landing Page Prompt Challenge**! We invite students from the **Universidade de Lisboa** to demonstrate their creativity and prompt-engineering skills by designing a brand-new landing page for **Air Apps** using **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**.
 
 Your challenge:
 
 1. Craft a **comprehensive prompt** that, when run on Claude, produces a well-structured, appealing landing page design for Air Apps.
 2. **Iterate** over your prompt (through multiple attempts if needed) until you achieve a final, polished result.
 3. **Submit** your best final prompt and **the link** to the resulting Claude chat transcript in our public GitHub repository. [https://github.com/airappsco/jobshop-ciencias-2025](https://github.com/airappsco/jobshop-ciencias-2025)
 
 We will evaluate how well your prompt leverages Claude’s capabilities to output a design that is visually and structurally compelling—without directly writing or embedding actual code. The best three submissions will receive fabulous prizes, a visit to Air Hub in Lisbon, and the chance to meet our engineers!
 
 ## The Goal
 
 * **Create a functional, visually compelling landing page design** for Air Apps using only prompt engineering.
